1. Finished adding scenes.
2. Finished implementing basic player control.
    Use arrow keys to go up or down. 
    Press 'F' to shoot. Currently, shooting mechanic is very basic. (Once bullets have traveled outside the screen, then you can shoot again)
    Haven't implemented collision for bullets with enemeis/obstacles.
3. Green tank is player.
4. Red tank is enemy player. (Doesn't shoot yet)
5. Black square is rock.
    It moves towards player.
    When collide with player, reset its position.
